K-Means
    1a. Cluster recipes together based on…
        - flavors
        - course/meal
        - common ingredients
        - subsets of common ingredients like spices, meats, sweets
        - cooking time
        - total calories
        - % calories from fat
        - # ingredients
        - average ingredient line length
    1b. Cluster ingredients together based on…
        - common ingredient/alias buddies 
          (implemented like synonyms from 107)
    2.  After clustering…
        - Manually label clusters as mexican/meats/breakfast/etc.

Search
    1.  Create a bigram frequency dictionary between the ingredient aliases 
        like we did for hw3 in cs221.
    2a. Given a starting ingredient, create the best recipe possible using 
        bigram costs. Number of ingredients must fall within a range.
    2b. Given no starting ingredient, randomly pick a starting ingredient.
        Then do weighted random choices on the next ingredients to make a
        recipe of a given size.

CSP, Factor Graphs
    1.  Do "Search" problem as stated above, but morph into a factor graph
        problem as follows:
            0.  If we have a 3-ingredient recipe, the variables would be as follows:
                - alias1, alias2, alias3
                    - e.g. "all-purpose flour", "garlic powder", "sugar"
                - amount1, amount2, amount3
                    - e.g. 600, 3, 20
                    - All amounts use the unit "grams" because that's what the
                      government nutritional database uses, which will allow us
                      to easily convert to nutritional content AND to the practical
                      units of measurement used for that ingredient (e.g. cups, tbsp, tsp)
                - Corresponding variables would likely be stored as 2-tuples
            1.  There is a weighted factor connecting all ingredient aliases
                whose weight is the sum of all bigram costs between the
                ingredients.
                    - In practice, we will do this by splitting into sum variables
                      in order to make all factors binary.
            2.  There are many constraints/weighted-factors connecting all
                ingredient amounts. 
                    - Example factors:
                        - Total calories
                        - Total mass
                        - Total volume (?possible?)
                        - Per 100 calories (one factor for each)...
                            - Fat, carbs, protein
                            - Sodium, cholesterol, fiber
                        - Per 100 grams (one factor for each)...
                            - Fat, carbs, protein
                            - Sodium, cholesterol, fiber
                        - Is it vegan?
                        - Is it nut-allergy okay?
                        - Is it gluten-free?
